Air Quality Prediction Project: Temperature Prediction Using Machine Learning
Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a complete machine learning pipeline for predicting temperature (target variable, y) using air quality sensor data. This pipeline involves data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. By leveraging sensor responses and atmospheric variables, the aim is to build a robust and accurate predictive model for temperature based on air quality metrics.

Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality

The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, contains air quality monitoring data collected from an Italian city. It focuses on key atmospheric pollutants such as Carbon Monoxide (CO), Non-Methanic Hydrocarbons, Benzene, Total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), along with other meteorological variables. These pollutants are known to deteriorate air quality, contribute to climate change, acid rain, and ecosystem damage, and pose significant health risks, especially in urban areas.

Key Highlights of the Dataset:
Features: 15 independent variables, including hourly averaged responses of sensors to air pollutants and meteorological variables.
Target Variable: Temperature (°C), which impacts pollution formation, dispersion, and energy usage.
Time Period: Data collected from March 2004 to February 2005.
Observations: 9,358 records.
Challenges: Missing values (denoted as -200) due to sensor drift and other limitations, requiring data cleaning.
Relevance:
Predictive models using this dataset can help cities better understand pollution dynamics and implement timely interventions to safeguard public health and the environment. Prolonged exposure to pollutants can lead to various health concerns, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative illnesses. Accurate predictions can inform future policies and strategies for air quality management.

Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Data Ingestion: Ensured data is in the correct format.
Handling Missing Values: Replaced or imputed missing values denoted by -200.
Incorrect Values: Addressed anomalies and inconsistencies in the data.
Outlier Detection and Handling: Identified and treated extreme values to prevent skewing model performance.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics: Summarized data using df.describe() to understand key statistics.
Distribution Analysis: Examined the distribution of continuous variables to detect skewness or irregularities.
3. Feature Engineering
Addressed positively skewed data to normalize distributions and improve model accuracy.
4. Feature Selection
Correlation Heatmap:
Identified highly correlated features to address multicollinearity.
L1 Regularization (Lasso):
Used Lasso regression to select the most relevant features.
5. Model Building, Selection, and Hyperparameter Tuning
Tested various regression models to find the best-performing one.
Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
6. Model Evaluation
Evaluated the model’s performance using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy, robustness, and reliability.

Conclusion
This project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to predict temperature using air quality data. By addressing challenges such as missing values and multicollinearity, and applying advanced modeling techniques, it demonstrates how data-driven approaches can aid in managing and improving air quality.
